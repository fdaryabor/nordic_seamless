# Nordic SEAMLESS Repository

This repository contains outputs and code developed under the SEAMLESS project for the CMEMS Arkona Basin site in the Baltic Sea.

## Project Overview

SEAMLESS (Services based on Ecosystem data AssiMiLation: Essential Science and Solutions) aims to improve the current European capability to simulate and predict the state of marine ecosystems. The project focuses on key state indicators linked to ocean “health” (such as oxygenation, acidification, and eutrophication), “services” (such as sustainable aquaculture), and the ocean's “response” to climate change (such as carbon transfer to the ocean depths).

These indicators are routinely monitored and/or simulated by observatories and models operated by the European Copernicus Marine Services (CMEMS). SEAMLESS enhances the existing CMEMS data assimilation methods that integrate observational and simulated indicators to provide more accurate marine forecasts and assessments.
